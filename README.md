## Installation

Head over to the releases page and download the file required by your operating system.

Mac builds are signed and notarized, so you shouldn't have any issue running them.

Windows builds are not signed because $500 is too much.
In order to run it, you'll need to click "More info" on the "Windows protected your PC" dialog.
Then click the "Run Anyway" button.
The code is open-source so you can review it yourself or have a trusted friend do so.
